# Dusty
Robot vacuum

## The goal
To build a robot vacuum using a 3d printer for the body and an arduino for the brains.

## A list of things
Initial dimensions: radius: 200mm, height 70mm (80mm is short enough to fit under my couch, 70mm + 10 mm of clearance).

### Parts
- 1x Arduino uno
- 2x ultrasonic sensors
- 2x wheel motors
- 3x voltage steppers
- 1x battery (specifications unclear at this time)
- 1x 3d printer

### 3d printed parts
- vacuum body (chasis)
- suction motor
- wheels
- arduino housing
- battery housing
- removable dust collection box

### To Do
- Design the vacuum body.
- Write up a script for the vacuum to navigate a path without bumping into things.
